# Airport Details

This Java web application has the ability to get data from JSON files. In this project, I used two different APIs but the same context is same. 

## How to use 
You can search any city name or airport code in the search bar i.e **Toronto or YYZ**.  In response, you will get a list of the airport. You can select one of them and then you have to click on get more details. You will be directed to the next scene. On that scene, you will find details like IATA code, ICAO code, Name, street number, street name, city, country, postal code, phone number, and website of the airport. Also, you can go back to the main page and search for any other airport.
